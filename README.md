# Trojan-horse-detection
Incorporating deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs to improve the accuracy and robustness of trojan detection and evaluating the models against real-world data with diverse features can validate their effectiveness. 

Step 1: Data Preprocessing
1. Load the Dataset: Utilize the pandaslibrary to load the Trojan detection dataset from
the specified file location.
2. Data Cleaning: Handle any missing or irrelevant data by dropping or imputing as
needed. Remove any duplicate records.
3. Label Encoding: Encode categorical features (e.g., "Flow ID", "Source IP",
"Destination IP", "Timestamp") using label encoding to convert them into numerical
form.
4. Class Label Encoding: Convert the class labels ("Trojan" and "Benign") into binary
numerical values (1 and 0, respectively).
5. Feature Selection: Utilize mutual information to select the top features that are most
informative for classification.


Step 2: Data Splitting
Train-Test Split: Divide the preprocessed data into training and testing sets (typically 80%
training, 20% testing) using train_test_split from scikit-learn.


Step 3: Apply Machine Learning Algorithms

Random Forest:
1. Train Random Forest Model:
Initialize and train a Random Forest Classifier with an appropriate number of
estimators (e.g., 50).
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.
2. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Explore different numbers of estimators to find the optimal configuration.

AdaBoost:
1. Train AdaBoost Model:
Initialize and train an AdaBoost Classifier (e.g., with 100 estimators).
Evaluate the model's accuracy on the test set.

Gaussian Naive Bayes:
1. Train Gaussian Naive Bayes Model:
Initialize and train a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier.
2. Cross-Validation:
Apply cross-validation to estimate the models' performance more robustly.


Step 4: Deep Learning with Feedforward Neural Network
1. Install Required Libraries:
Install TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and pandas if not already installed.
2. Data Preprocessing for Neural Network:
Standardize the input data using StandardScaler.
Define the architecture of a feedforward neural network with appropriate activation
functions and layers.
3. Train the Neural Network:
4. Compile and train the neural network on the preprocessed data for a specified
number of epochs.
